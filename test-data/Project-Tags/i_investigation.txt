"Study Protocol Description"	"collections were conducted between 17:30 and 20:00h, May - November 2006"	"Species were identified by morphological characters of the females using characteristics of wings and posterior legs (Faran 1980, Faran & Linthicum 1981)"	"Correct taxonomical identification of specimens lacking clear morphological characters was confirmed through PCR-RFLP (Ruiz et al. 2005)."	"The dose response was assayed using the WHO paper kit."	"Bottles were prepared following the Brogdon and McAllister (1998) protocol. Each population was evaluated with diagnostic doses and times previously established for A. nuneztovari (Fonseca-González 2008). Fifteen to 20 non-blood fed females from each site were introduced in 250 mL glass bottles coated with the diagnostic dose of each insecticide. Each test consisted of four treated bottles and one control bottle that was treated with ethanol only. At least three tests were done for each insecticide and population."	"The Caño Victoria strain was used as a standard population susceptible in all the biochemical analysis performed. For the MFO assay, absorbance was measured at 620 nm after 5 min incubation with 2 mM 3,3’,5,5’-tetramethyl-benzidina."	"The Caño Victoria strain was used as a standard population susceptible in all the biochemical analysis performed. NSE levels were measured at 540 nm after 10 min incubation with 3 mM β-naphthyl acetate."	"The Caño Victoria strain was used as a standard population susceptible in all the biochemical analysis performed. Modified acetylcholin esterase (MACE); Biochemical assay to measure levels and activity of AChE in a biological sample. MACE levels were measured in the reaction containing 2.6 mM acetylthiocholine iodide, 0.3 mM dithio-bis-2-nitrobenzoic acid and 100 mM propoxur. The reaction rates were measured at 414 nm at 10 min."	"The Caño Victoria strain was used as a standard population susceptible in all the biochemical analysis performed. Glutathione S-transferases (GST) levels were measured in the reaction containing 2 mM reduced glutathione and 1 mM 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene. The reaction rates were measured at 340 nm at 5 min."
