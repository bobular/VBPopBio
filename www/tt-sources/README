This directory contains Template Toolkit source files for generating the
VectorBase popgen HTML/Javascript front end.
( http://search.cpan.org/~abw/Template-Toolkit/ )


HTML, CSS and JS sources are in src/

EXCEPT FOR src/js/phenovis-0.01.js which you can get from
https://github.com/sethnr/phenovis (then: ant vb_frontend)
or https://svn.vectorbase.org:8800/popdb/trunk/turnkey-site/htdocs/js/phenovis-0.01.js


include files (such as header, footer) are in lib/

To generate the content, type this FROM THIS DIRECTORY

  ttree -a -f ttree-XXX.cfg

Where XXX is the flavour of rollout you require
(e.g. XXX=dev -> content lands in ../apache/dev/htdocs)

The -a forces it to ignore timestamps and update everything.

There's one more config file, lib/config-XXX.tt, which you will probably want
to edit to set the server/json roots etc.

See also README-turnkey-site for updating that.

Or try Bob's ~/bin/on-change-run script, for auto-updating:

  on-change-run ttree -a -f ttree-dev.cfg
